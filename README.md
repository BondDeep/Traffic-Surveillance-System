# Traffic-Surveillance-System

## A traffic surveillance system for obtaining comprehensive vehicle information, including type, number of axles, 3D bounding box, speed, length, current driving lane, and traffic volume, is proposed [1].


  The system is tested in three different videos. Video1 and Video2 are captured from the North and South towers of Anqing Yangtze River highway bridge in China and Video3 is from the standard dataset [2]. Some experimental results are shown in the File 'Videos'. 


### Video1 is captured from North tower (show with 10FPS)

### Video2 is captured from South tower (show with 10FPS)
